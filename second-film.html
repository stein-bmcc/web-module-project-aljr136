        <h3> The film Malcolm X film directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington is a powerful and thought provoking biographiocal drama that explores the life of the civil rights leader Malcolm X. I love this film because it shows the life and growth of Malcolm X from when he was was born to the point of when he was assassinated. Denzel Washington's performance is so gripping and power when watching him protray Malcolm from a street hustler to a passionate advocate for racial justice. The film handles themes such as identity, faith, and empowerment, while also confronting the harsh realities of racism in America. </h3>
