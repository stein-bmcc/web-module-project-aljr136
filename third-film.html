        <h3> The film All That Jazz directed by Bob Fosse and starring Roy Scheider is a semi-autobiographical film loosley based on Bob Fosse life. I love this film because it's both a musical and a drama that shows the chaotic life of a Broadway choreographer Joe Gideon, played by Roy Schieder. The film is a complex film that displays to some capocity of show business and the pros and cons that come with it such as fame, excess, and the human cost of the artistic ambition.</h3>
